# reason-server

This is an example reason project trying out cohttp and the esy workflow. I am still learning Reason
and the OCaml ecosystem, so it's far from an exemplar. Emulate at your own risk.

## Building

```bash
yarn global add esy
esy
```

## Running

```bash
esy run
```

## Testing

```bash
# Runs the "test" command in `package.json`.
esy test
```
